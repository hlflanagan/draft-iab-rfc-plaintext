  <abstract>
      <t>In 2013, after a great deal of community discussion, the decision 
      was made to shift from the plain-text, ASCII-only canonical format for
      RFCs to XML as the canonical format with more human-readable formats 
      rendered from that XML.  The high-level requirements that
      informed this change were defined in RFC6949, "RFC Series Format 
      Requirements and Future Development."  Plain text remains an important
      format for many in the IETF community, and will still be one of the 
      publication formats rendered from the XML.  This draft documents 
      the rendering requirements for the plain-text RFC publication format.  
      These requirements do not apply to plain-text RFCs published before
      the format transition.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In 2013, after a great deal of community discussion, the decision 
      was made to shift from the plain-text, ASCII-only canonical format for
      RFCs to XML as the canonical format <xref target="XML-ANNOUNCE"/>.  
      The high-level requirements that informed this change were defined in 
      <xref target="RFC6949"/>, "RFC Series Format Requirements and Future 
      Development."  Plain text remains an important format for many in the 
      IETF community, and will still be one of the publication formats 
      rendered from the XML. This draft documents the rendering requirements 
      for the plain-text RFC publication format. These requirements do not 
      apply to plain-text RFCs published before the format transition.</t>

      <t>The Unicode Consortium defines 'plain text' as 
      <xref target="UNICODE-GLOSSARY">"Computer-encoded text that consists 
      only of a sequence of code points from a given standard, with no 
      other formatting or structural information.  Plain text interchange is 
      commonly used between computer systems that do not share higher-level 
      protocols." </xref>  In other words, plain-text files cannot include 
      embedded character formatting or style information.  The actual character 
      encoding, however, is not limited to any particular sequence of code
      points.</t>

      <t>A plain-text output for RFCs will continue to be required
      for the foreseeable future.  The details of what that means for RFCs in 
      terms of which character encoding may be used, what the page layout 
      will look like, how to handle figures and artwork, and how pagination 
      will be handled, are documented in this memo.  For more details on 
      general style, see <xref target="RFC7322">"The RFC Style Guide."</xref></t>

      <t>The following assumptions drive the changes in the plain-text
      output for RFCs:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>The existing tools used by the RFC Editor and many members
              of the author community to create the text file are complicated
              to change and support; manual manipulation is often required 
              for the final output.  In particular, handling page breaks and 
              associated widows and orphans for paginated output is tricky
              <xref target="WIDOWS"/>.</t>
              <t>Additional publication formats--for example: PDF, HTML--will
              be available that will offer features such as markup, 
              pretty printing, etc. </t> 
              <t>There is an extensive tool chain in existence among the 
              community to work with plain-text documents.  Similar 
              functionality may be possible with other publication formats, 
              but the workflow that uses the existing tool chain should be 
              supported as much as is considered practical.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
      <t>Where practical, the original guidance for the structure of a 
      plain-text RFC has been kept, such as with line lengths, lines per 
      page, etc. <xref target="INS2AUTH"/></t>

<t>The details described in this document are expected to change based on experience gained in implementing the RFC production center's toolset. Revised documents will be published capturing those changes as the toolset is completed. Other implementers must not expect those changes to remain backwards-compatible with the details described this document.</t>

    <section title="Character Encoding">
      <t>Plain-text files for RFCs will use the 
      <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref> character encoding.  That said, 
      the use of non-ASCII characters will be only allowed in a limited and
      controlled fashion.</t>

      <t>Many elements within the xml2rfc v3 vocabulary have an attribute
      for the ASCII equivalent to a non-ASCII character string. The ASCII
      equivalent will be rendered within the plain-text as per the guidance in
       <xref target="I-D.iab-rfc-nonascii">"The Use of Non-ASCII
      Characters in RFCs"</xref>.  Please view the PDF version of that draft.
      </t>

      <t>The plain-text file will include a byte order mark (BOM) to provide 
      text reader software with in-band information about the character 
      encoding scheme used. </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Figures and Artwork">
      <t>Artwork is defined as anything marked by the XML &gt;artwork&lt; 
      element (see Section 2.5 of <xref target="I-D.iab-xml2rfc">
      "The 'XML2RFC' version 3 Vocabulary"</xref>. Only 
      the 'type=ascii-art' will be rendered within the plain-text format.
      This marks figures drawn with ASCII characters.</t>

      <t>If the canonical format includes figures or artwork other than 
      ASCII-art, then the plain-text output must include a pointer to the 
      relevant figure in the HTML version of the RFC to allow readers to see 
      the relevant artwork.</t>

      <t>Authors who wish to include ASCII-art for the plain-text file and 
      SVG art for the other outputs may do so, but they should be aware of the
      potential for confusion to individuals reading the RFC with two unique
      diagrams describing the same content.  If there is conflicting 
      information between the publication formats, please review the XML and 
      PDF files to resolve the conflict.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="General Page Format Layout">
       <t>One plain-text output will be created during the publication
       process with basic pagination that includes a form feed instruction 
       every 58 lines at most, including blank lines.  Instructions or a 
       script will be made available by and for the community to strip out 
       pagination as per individual preference. </t>

        <section title="Headers and Footers">
          <t>The front matter on the front page (such as the RFC number 
          and category), and the back matter on the last page (the author's 
          full names and contact information) will continue with the 
          structure described in <xref target="RFC5741">RFC 5741</xref>, 
          "RFC Streams, Headers, and Boilerplates".  Running headers and 
          footers will no longer be added.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Table of Contents">
          <t>In order to retain similar content wherever possible between
          the various publication formats, the Table of Contents will list 
          section and subsection numbers and titles, but will not include 
          page numbers.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Line Width">
          <t>Each line must be limited to 72 characters followed by the
          character sequence that denotes an end-of-line (EOL).  The EOL
          sequence used by the RFC Editor will be the two-character sequence
          CR LF (Carriage Return followed by Line Feed).  This
          limit includes any left-side indentation.</t>

          <t>Note that the EOL used by the RFC Editor may change with different
          transports and as displayed in different display software.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Line Spacing">
          <t>Use single-spaced text within a paragraph, and one blank line
           between paragraphs.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Hyphenation">
          <t>Hyphenated words (e.g., "Internet-Draft"), should not be split 
          across successive lines. 
          </t>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="elements" title="Elements from the xml2rfc v3 vocabulary">
        <t>The plain-text does not attempt to render anything but the most
        basic document metadata from the XML. The document layout and 
        structure is instead guided directly by the RFC Style Guide and the 
        updates reflected in the web portion of the Style Guide 
        <xref target="STYLEWEB"/>.
        URIs that occur in targets may be placed into parenthetical 
        expressions or reference entries <xref target="I-D.iab-xml2rfc"/>.
        </t>

        <t>Since plain-text cannot include any rich-text-style formatting, 
        such as bold or italic fonts, tags such as &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;
        will not be rendered in any way in the plain-text draft.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The requirements of the plaintext format involve no significant security considerations. As part of the larger format project, however, unintended changes to the text as a result of the transformation from the base XML file could in turn corrupt a standard, practice or critical piece of information about a protocol.</t>
